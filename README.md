Rhythm Memory Game

Overview:

Rhythm Memory Game invites players into a unique blend of memory challenge and musical rhythm. Participants are tasked with uncovering a sequence of tiles that play distinct musical notes in a predetermined order. With each correct move, they march forward in tempo, while missteps can halt the melody, urging them to try again.

Gameplay:

Initialization: The game starts with a set of cards/tiles shuffled randomly. A few of these tiles (defaulted to four) are designated as the target sequence the player has to remember.

PreRoll Phase: Before the challenge begins, players are given a visual and auditory cue of the sequence. They need to remember the order and the corresponding tiles.

Play Phase: Once the sequence ends, players replicate the same order by clicking on the tiles. Each correct click in sequence rewards with a green light and a musical note, whereas a wrong move is signaled with red and may result in lost lives.

Progression: Successive wins may lead players to tougher challenges, potentially demanding a longer sequence or faster tempo.

Lives: Players are given a limited number of lives. An incorrect sequence will decrease one life. If all lives are lost, the game starts over.

Features:

Dynamic Tile Generation: The game doesn't limit you to a fixed number of cards. Adjust the numberOfCards to generate the desired number of tiles.

Customizable Sounds: The game supports attaching custom musical notes/sounds to tiles for a more immersive experience.

Intuitive Feedback: Players get instant feedback via visual (color-coded tiles and numbers) and auditory cues (musical notes).

Adaptive Difficulty: As players progress, the challenge intensifies, demanding higher concentration and rhythm accuracy.

How To Play:
Observe the sequence during the PreRoll Phase.

Once the sequence ends, replicate it by clicking on the tiles in the correct order.

Make sure to click in rhythm, matching the tempo provided!

Keep progressing until you either complete the challenge or run out of lives.
